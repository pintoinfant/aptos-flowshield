## üîß Advanced Setup

### Contract Deployment (For Developers)

```bash
cd contracts

# Compile the smart contracts
npm run move:compile

# Run unit tests
npm run move:test

# Deploy to devnet (requires Aptos CLI setup)
npm run move:publish

# Initialize pool denominations
aptos move run \
  --function-id 'default::privacy_pool::add_pool' \
  --type-args '0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin' \
  --args u64:10000000 "string:0.1 APT Pool" \
  --assume-yes
```

### Relayer Service Setup

The relayer service enables gas-free withdrawals by paying transaction fees and earning a 5% service fee.

1. **Generate Relayer Account**:
```bash
aptos init --network devnet
# Save the private key for RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY
```

2. **Fund Relayer Account**:
```bash
aptos account fund-with-faucet --account your_relayer_address
```

3. **Configure Environment**:
```env
RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
```

4. **Test Relayer API**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/resolver \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "secretHash": "your_secret_hash",
    "amount": 0.1,
    "recipientAddress": "0xrecipient_address"
  }'
```

## üí° How FlowShield Works

### Privacy Mechanism Deep Dive

#### 1. **Deposit Phase**
```typescript
// User generates random secret
const secret = crypto.getRandomValues(new Uint8Array(32));

// Create cryptographic commitment
const secretHash = sha256(secret);

// Deposit to smart contract with commitment
await contract.deposit(secretHash, amount);

// Receive secret note: "flowshield-{amount}-{secret_hex}"
const secretNote = `flowshield-${amount}-${secret.toString('hex')}`;
```

#### 2. **Privacy Pool Mixing**
- Multiple users deposit into fixed denomination pools (0.1, 1, 10, 100 APT)
- Funds are pooled together, breaking individual transaction links
- Larger pools provide stronger anonymity sets
- Smart contract maintains deposit commitments without revealing connections

#### 3. **Withdrawal Phase**
```typescript
// From any wallet, parse secret note
const [, amount, secretHex] = secretNote.split('-');
const secret = Buffer.from(secretHex, 'hex');
const secretHash = sha256(secret);

// Two withdrawal options:

// Option A: Direct withdrawal (requires gas)
await contract.withdraw_direct(secretHash, amount);

// Option B: Relayer withdrawal (gas-free, 5% fee)
await fetch('/api/resolver', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ secretHash, amount, recipientAddress })
});
```

### Security Properties

- **Unlinkability**: No on-chain connection between deposit and withdrawal addresses
- **Anonymity**: Users hidden within the anonymity set of their pool
- **Non-custodial**: Smart contract holds funds, no trusted third parties
- **Verifiable**: All transactions are publicly auditable on-chain

---

## üìä Live Demo Walkthrough

### Step 1: Visit FlowShield
Navigate to the landing page and click "Launch App"

### Step 2: Connect Wallet
Connect your Petra wallet to the application

### Step 3: Make a Deposit
1. Select a pool amount (0.1, 1, 10, or 100 APT)
2. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
3. **IMPORTANT**: Save the secret note that appears - you'll need it to withdraw!

### Step 4: Wait for Anonymity
Wait for other users to deposit into the same pool (or use multiple test wallets)

### Step 5: Withdraw Privately
1. Switch to a different wallet or use the relayer service
2. Enter your secret note
3. Specify the recipient address
4. Choose withdrawal method:
   - **Direct**: Requires APT for gas, no fees
   - **Relayer**: Gas-free, 5% service fee

### Step 6: Verify Privacy
Check blockchain explorer - no connection between your deposit and withdrawal addresses!

Problem: "Invalid secret note format"
Solution:
1. Ensure format is: flowshield-{amount}-{secret}
2. Check for extra spaces or characters
3. Make sure you copied the complete note
4. Verify the amount matches available pools
```

#### **Relayer Service Issues**
```
Problem: "Relayer service unavailable"
Solution:
1. Check RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY is configured
2. Ensure relayer account has sufficient APT

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### **Q: Is FlowShield safe to use?**
A: FlowShield is a hackathon project and hasn't undergone professional security audits. Use only on testnet with amounts you can afford to lose. The smart contract uses Move's safety features, but additional security reviews are needed for production use.

#### **Q: How private are my transactions?**
A: FlowShield breaks the on-chain link between deposit and withdrawal addresses. Privacy strength depends on the anonymity set size (number of deposits in your pool). Larger pools provide stronger privacy guarantees.

#### **Q: What happens if I lose my secret note?**
A: Secret notes are the only way to access your deposited funds. If lost, funds cannot be recovered. Always store secret notes securely and consider making encrypted backups.

#### **Q: How do withdrawal fees work?**
A: Direct withdrawals only pay network gas fees (very low on Aptos). Relayer withdrawals are gas-free for users but include a 5% service fee that goes to the relayer operator.

#### **Q: Can I withdraw to the same address I deposited from?**
A: Technically yes, but this defeats the privacy purpose. FlowShield is designed for withdrawing to different addresses to break transaction links.

#### **Q: What pool sizes are available?**
A: Currently 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 APT pools are available. Custom amounts may be added in future updates based on community feedback.
